# EdgeRetention

This is an attempt predict edge retention for based on steal composition using cut test data from a youtuber named
Cedric and Ada who cuts sisal rope with various knife steal types until the blade will no longer slice paper cleanly.
I augmented his data with the steel composition percentages and removed some test cases which I could not find data for,
or for which data did not make sense such as tungsten carbide or ceramic. Some limmitations of the data are that I do
not have hardness or stock thickness for all theses cases.
